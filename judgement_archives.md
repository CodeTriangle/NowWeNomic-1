#CFJ-01

Called by @JustSomeSmallQs

Judge: @h2g2_researcher (speaker)

Statement:

> The revelation of votes in accordance with Rule 208 need not associate a Voter with eir vote,
but must only provide an accurate count of votes in favor of the proposal and votes against the proposal.

Judgement: TRUE

Comments: There is no actual requirement to reveal who voted for which side.
Some information may be derived from the points changes after a vote closes.
However, the speaker may - if they wish - reveal who voted for what, and I believe they should.
This is because the speaker is a player as well, and once their term as speaker is over knowledge
of who specifically voted for or against which proposals may be used to create an unfair advantage.
