Statement:

> The revelation of votes in accordance with Rule 208 need not associate a Voter with eir vote,
but must only provide an accurate count of votes in favor of the proposal and votes against the proposal.

Judgement: TRUE

Comments: There is no actual requirement to reveal who voted for which side.
Some information may be derived from the points changes after a vote closes.
However, the speaker may - if they wish - reveal who voted for what, and I believe they should.
This is because the speaker is a player as well, and once their term as speaker is over knowledge
of who specifically voted for or against which proposals may be used to create an unfair advantage.

Statement:

> For the purposes of point collection in Rule 211, there can only be one author of a proposal.

Judgement: FALSE

Comments: Quoting from 211: "Players whose proposals are adopted shall receive a random number of points in the range 1-10 inclusive.  Players whose proposals are not adopted shall lose 10 points."

Use of the term "players" over  "a player" can grammatically refer to multiple players. Similarly in rule 204: "Only Voters may make proposals" the language does not use a singular noun, and therefore it would be valid to have multiple voters making a single proposal.

Judge: @silverlava (voter, chosen randomly)

Statement to be judged:

> A single proposal may create, amend, or repeal multiple rules.

Judgement: FALSE

Rule 105 states that a rule change is defined as the enactment, repeal, or amendment of a mutable rule.

“A mutable rule” is singular. Therefore, each proposal can only affect one rule.

If this were to be judged true, and a proposal that amends multiple rules were to pass, then according to rule 109, both amended rules would receive the number of the proposal.

Having two rules with the same number would be confusing and annoying to work with.

Judge: @h2g2_researcher (speaker)

Statement:

> Public votes are equally as enforceable for the purposes of the rules as votes sent privately to the Speaker, so a vote sent publicly need not also be sent privately to the Speaker

Verdict: UNDECIDED

The only requirement on a vote is that it is received by the speaker. This implies the speaker may accept any clear and unambiguous statement to vote at eir discretion. By convention a private message sent to the speaker has been accepted. However, the speaker is under no particular obligation to monitor the various chats, and a vote simply left on a proposal discussion thread may be a) interpreted as midirection, and b) isn't aimed at the speaker necessarily. (Certainly if the speaker doesn't acknowledge it as cast vote, it cannot be considered as such.)

It is therefore recommended that votes are cast via PM to the speaker, or - if the player insists on voting publicly - the speaker should be tagged with @Speaker to ensure e is aware of the vote cast.
