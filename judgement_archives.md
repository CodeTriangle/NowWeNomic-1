Statement:

> The revelation of votes in accordance with Rule 208 need not associate a Voter with eir vote,
but must only provide an accurate count of votes in favor of the proposal and votes against the proposal.

Judgement: TRUE

Comments: There is no actual requirement to reveal who voted for which side.
Some information may be derived from the points changes after a vote closes.
However, the speaker may - if they wish - reveal who voted for what, and I believe they should.
This is because the speaker is a player as well, and once their term as speaker is over knowledge
of who specifically voted for or against which proposals may be used to create an unfair advantage.

Statement:

> For the purposes of point collection in Rule 211, there can only be one author of a proposal.

Judgement: FALSE

Comments: Quoting from 211: "Players whose proposals are adopted shall receive a random number of points in the range 1-10 inclusive.  Players whose proposals are not adopted shall lose 10 points."

Use of the term "players" over  "a player" can grammatically refer to multiple players. Similarly in rule 204: "Only Voters may make proposals" the language does not use a singular noun, and therefore it would be valid to have multiple voters making a single proposal.
